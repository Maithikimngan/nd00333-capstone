# Capstone Project

This project addresses a classification problem using both Hyperparameters HyperDrive and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to optimize and deploy the best model. The objective is to utilize both the HyperDrive and AutoML APIs provided by Azure to develop and refine this project.
The dataset for this project pertains to the survival probability of Titanic passengers, which has been sourced from Kaggle. The comprehensive steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. Dataset Selection:
- Select the Titanic passenger survival probability dataset as the primary dataset for this project.
2. Data Importation:
- Import the chosen dataset into the Azure workspace for further analysis and model training.
3. Model Training:
- Automated Machine Learning (AutoML): Leverage Azure's AutoML to automate the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- HyperDrive: Employ HyperDrive to further fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
4. Model Comparison:
- Evaluate and compare the performance of the models generated by AutoML and HyperDrive to determine the most effective model.
5. Model Deployment:
- Deploy the best-performing model to a production environment for real-world application.
6. Endpoint Testing:
- Test the deployed model's endpoint to ensure it operates correctly and delivers accurate predictions.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset
This is the Titanic dataset taken from Kaggle with link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data 
Below is description of data:
- Survived: if the passenger survived or not (True/False)
- Pclass: the	Ticket class	(1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Sex:	Gender	(Male, Female)
- Age: the passenger's age (20, 30, 45, ...)
- SibSp: the	number of siblings / spouses	(0, 2, 3, ...)
- Parch: the	number of parents / children (0, 1, 2, ...)
- Ticket:	th ticket id (A/5 21171, ...)
- Fare: the	Passenger fare (10.34, 8.50, ...)
- Cabin: the	cabin id	(A12, B34, ...)
- Embarked: the	Port of Embarkation	(C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
### Overview
