# Capstone Project

This project addresses a classification problem using both Hyperparameters HyperDrive and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to optimize and deploy the best model. The objective is to utilize both the HyperDrive and AutoML APIs provided by Azure to develop and refine this project.
The dataset for this project pertains to the survival probability of Titanic passengers, which has been sourced from Kaggle. The comprehensive steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. Dataset Selection:
- Select the Titanic passenger survival probability dataset as the primary dataset for this project.
2. Data Importation:
- Import the chosen dataset into the Azure workspace for further analysis and model training.
3. Model Training:
3.1. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML):
- Leverage Azure's AutoML to automate the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
3.2. HyperDrive:
- Employ HyperDrive to further fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
4. Model Comparison:
- Evaluate and compare the performance of the models generated by AutoML and HyperDrive to determine the most effective model.
5. Model Deployment:
- Deploy the best-performing model to a production environment for real-world application.
6. Endpoint Testing:
- Test the deployed model's endpoint to ensure it operates correctly and delivers accurate predictions.

## Project Set Up and Installation

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search
